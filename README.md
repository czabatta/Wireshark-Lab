# Wireshark-Lab
Hunting Clear Text Credentials
## Objective

The objective of this lab is to extract cleartext passwords from the capture file.
You can view detected credentials using the "Tools --> Credentials" menu.
Once you use the feature, it will open a new window and provide detected credentials. It will show the packet number, protocol, username and additional information. 
This window is clickable; clicking on the packet number will select the packet containing the password, and clicking on the username will select the packet containing the username info. 
The additional part prompts the packet number that contains the username.
